# Fantasy Rules
### Ultra-Light Edition
**Tiny d10: Fantasy** is an easy to learn, quick to play tabletop role-playing game (RPG) in the fantasy tradition that requires only paper, pencil, and a single 10-sided die (1d10). The complete rules are presented here in ultra-abbreviated format.

## Character Creation
When creating your character, consider things like his or her appearance, background, and general attitude.

### Races
**Step 1:** Select a race.

**Dwarf** – gain +1 damage against goblins; +1 hit point (HP) per level; the *craft* skill.

**Elf** – gain +1 damage against evil creatures; +1 to perception checks; +1 intellect.

**Halfling** – gain +1 power point (PP) per level; -1 to ranged attacks against the halfling; the *hide* skill ***or*** the *sneak* skill.

**Human** – gain +1 attack bonus against natural beasts; the *persuade* skill; +1 aspect.

### Classes
**Step 2:** Select a class.

**Cleric** – a holy warrior that possesses divine magic and powerful healing abilities. They have a toughness of 6 (T6); use middleweight weapons & below; use middleweight armor & below; and gain +1 MP and +2 PP. Clerics begin with *spell-casting (divine)* and 1 additional class ability.

**Rogue** – a quick-thinking, fast-acting outlaw. They have a toughness of 6 (T6); use mediumweight weapons & below; use lightweight armor; and gain +1 HP and +2 PP. Rogues begin with 3 class abilities.

**Warrior** – a master of combat and arms. They have a toughness of 7 (T7); use all types of weapons and armor; and gain +2 HP and +1 PP. Warriors begin with 2 class abilities.

**Wizard** – a wise and cunning student of the magical arts. They have a toughness of 5 (T5); use only lightweight weapons; use only featherweight armor; and gain +3 MP. Wizards begin with *spell-casting (magical)* and 2 additional class abilities.

### Attributes
**Step 3:** Divide 3 points between the following attributes.

**Aspect (A)** – awareness and charisma.

**Intellect (I)** – mental acuity and sharpness.

**Power (P)** – physical and mental strength.

**Reflex (R)** – dexterity and speed.

### Hit Points & Power Points
**Step 4:** Divide 10 points between hit points and power points.

**Hit points (HP)** – amount of damage a character can suffer before falling unconscious, and eventually dying. A successful attack typically deals 1 point of damage.

**Power points (PP)** – added to attack rolls, check rolls, and challenge rolls. Power points must be added before the roll is conducted, and only 1 point may be added per roll. Unless otherwise specified, they cannot be used to increase damage.

### Magic Points
**Step 5:** Generate magic points (applies only to magic-users like the cleric or wizard).

Roll 1d10: On a roll of 1-5, gain +4 magic points; on a roll of 6-9, gain +5 magic points; on a roll of 10, gain +6 magic points.

**Magic points (MP)** – expended to cast spells. Classes with the spell-casting ability begin with a certain amount of MP.

### Wealth
**Step 6:** Generate starting wealth.

Roll 1d10 for *gold* (gp), *silver* (sp), and *copper* pieces (cp), multiplying each result by 10.

1gp = $50 | 1sp = $10 | 1cp = $1

## Playing the Game
Tiny d10 is a role-playing game, so most interactions should be role-played. However, there will be times when a die roll is unavoidable. Any attempt to do something that could result in failure requires a check.

### Checks
When attempting to do something that could result in failure – like fording a raging river, staying astride a frightened horse, or hearing the soft footsteps of approaching enemies – a check should be made.

To make a check, roll 1d10 and add the relevant attribute score (**aspect**, **intellect**, **power**, or **reflex**) and any relevant skill bonuses.

There are two types of checks:

**Action checks** are attempts to perform actions like climbing towers, dodging falling rocks, or hiding in nearby bushes. Action checks include attack rolls, challenges, and saves.

**Perception checks** are attempts to perceive something, like seeing hidden or obscured objects and creatures, or hearing hushed voices and furtive movements. Perception checks are performed by rolling 1d10 and adding the **intellect** attribute score. Bonuses from the *spot* and/or *listen* skills may also be added, as relevant.

To determine a check’s **toughness (T)**, consider the following:

* **Simple toughness (T2-5)** – pulling an ally up from a ledge or climbing a wall with large handholds.
* **Moderate toughness (T6-9)** – surprising unaware opponents or fighting a strong current.
* **Difficult toughness (T10-11)** – surprising watchful opponents or picking an expertly crafted lock.
* **Extreme toughness (T12-13)** – leaping across a massive chasm or scaling a sheer and smooth stone precipice.
* **Impossible toughness (T14-15)** – controlling a ship during a gale or mounting and flying a wild dragon.

### Saves
When there is risk of immediate death or dismemberment – or similarly dire consequences – a save should be made. A standard save is performed by rolling 1d10 and adding relevant attribute scores and/or skill bonuses to the result. Succeeding a save cancels any deadly effects, but other effects (like serious injury) may still occur. A standard save has a **toughness of 5 (T5)**, but certain conditions (e.g. spells, effects, environmental factors, etc.) can change that.

### Challenges
When two entities attempt the same thing at the same time, a challenge should be performed: roll 1d10 and add the relevant attribute and skill bonuses. The highest of the two results succeeds.

### Combat
Combat begins according to **reflex** scores: highest first, lowest last. Ties should be settled with a roll. Attack rolls work like action or perception checks. Roll 1d10 and add the relevant attribute score: if the result is equal to or higher than the target’s toughness, the attack is successful.

#### Movement in Combat
During combat, all classes are moderate in speed (unless otherwise specified) and may only move up to their maximum speed range per turn, though other factors – such as terrain – may affect this.

Slow = 40 ft. | Moderate = 60 ft. | Fast = 80 ft.

#### Simplified Combat Rules
1. One combat *round* consists of all combatants' *turns*; each turn represents roughly 5 seconds.
2. Only one attack/ability/spell per turn (unless otherwise noted).
3. Only one movement sequence per turn (if standing up after being knocked prone, movement range is reduced by half).
4. Less significant actions (talking, passing or throwing an object, etc.) may be done freely.
5. Damage inflicted is 1 (unless otherwise noted).
6. Divine spells use **aspect**; magical spells use **intellect**; melee attacks use **power**; ranged and small weapon (e.g. dagger) attacks use **reflex**.

### Healing
At 0 hit points, characters are considered immobilized and dying, and will expire after 5 combat rounds. Standard healing restores 1-2 hit points, magic points, and power points per successful T6 intellect check (if the character possesses the *heal* skill, healing is an automatic success). Magical healing generally does not restore magic or power points (unless otherwise specified).

During combat, an entire turn must be forfeit to heal (or to make a heal check). Out of combat, characters may make 1 heal check per every 4 in-game hours or spend an entire day resting to restore 1d5 + 2 hit points, magic points, and power points.

### Class Abilities
Abilities are special feats and tactics that enhance a character’s proficiencies, and sometimes require the use of power points to invoke. Unless otherwise specified, abilities that target opponents require an attack roll versus toughness (as relevant).

### Skills
Skills are specific competencies and can only be used in specific scenarios. For example: The *spot* skill can be used in a perception check to see something; the *persuade* skill can be used in an aspect check to convince someone of something. When used, skills add a +1 bonus to checks. Skills can be used during combat, but not for combat.

#### Aspect-based Skills
* Charm
* Detect (*magic* or *motive*)
* Heal
* Intimidate
* Persuade
* Survival

#### Intellect-based Skills
* Craft
* Detect trap
* Know (*history*, *nature*, or *religion*)
* Listen
* Magic use
* Spot

#### Reflex-based Skills
* Acrobatics
* Disarm trap
* Hide
* Pick lock
* Sleight-of-hand
* Sneak

### Magic
Magic is conjured using magic points (MP). Typically, only characters that possess the spell-casting class ability can use magic. Unless otherwise specified, spells are an automatic success.
